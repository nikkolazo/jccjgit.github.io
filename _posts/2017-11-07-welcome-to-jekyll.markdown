Here is where it all starts.

This website is intended as a public record of some of the work I'll be doing throughout my studies in machine and statistical learning.

The material will include but will not be limited to:

- notes on book sections
- reports on databases analysis results
- source code for the above analysis.

See you soon with my first material.
